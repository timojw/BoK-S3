__Threat + Risk Analysis for the test Web Shop__

__RELEVANCE__

Before starting the semester it is imporant to be aware of certain Cyber Security Threats. And how to analize the risks for security threats.

__STARTING POINT__

Before researching this I had heard of only some very well known cyber security threats such as: spam, some malware and DDOS attacks. Although I did not know much about that and would like to learn more about them as well as many more threats. I have also previously setup a test web shop.

__APPROACH__

I'm planning to find out more about them by researching the canvas pages, presentations prepared by teachers as well as doing my own research online outside of canvas. After which I will try to do some Risk Analysis on my own test web shop.

__BACKGROUND INFORMATION__

There are a lot more examples of cyber threats: malware, spam, phishing, adware, ransomware and many more. It is important to know how to detect them and find out what risks a online environment is taking.

After taking a look I found out that there are three points of reliability: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availibility. Afgekort: CIA
At the core of information security is information assurance, the act of maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of information. 
- Confidentiality:
  Confidentiality is a component of privacy that implements to protect our data from unauthorized viewers.
- Integrity:
  In information security, data integrity means maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data.
- Availability:
  The information must be available when it is needed. This means the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly.

Also found out that there are a few different ways to mitigate risks: First of all it is an option to accept the risk, avoid the risk, transfer the risk somewhere else, it might also be possible to reduce the risk. 
There are certain types of risk analysis: Qualitative risk analysis, which means you qualify the risks incurred by a High, Medium or a Low risk. 
There is also Quantitative risk analysis which is the most extended form of risk analysis. There is a easy formula used for quantitive risk analysis: Risk = Probability x Damage.

__EXECUTION__

Quantitative risk analysis on the restaurant I work at.
For this part I will follow the formula explained above: Risk = Probability x Damage
The probability of someone trying to break into the website for the restaurant is low, around 10% cause there are not a lot of people with any motivation to do so. 
If someone was to succeed in doing so, there will be little damage done. The website does contain any sensitive information of previous customers. there is also the probability of paying information being left vulnerable. This is why I would say the potential damage is big.
Risk = 10 x 80 = 800

This means that there is quite a bit of risk at the moment.

__AFTERTHOUGHTS__
Doing the exercise for Quantitative risk analysis was quite useless with the example I chose. It would be way more interesting to do that for a company or website that has a more interestin IT environment.
