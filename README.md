## Web Application Security (week 1-4)
The first week of the semester I was not yet back from my summer vacation. This was unfortunate ofcourse, although I was able to look into the semester structure, learning outcomes and planning during this week. The fact that I was not able to join the class during this week was communicated as soon as possible to my teachers.

Before starting the semester it is imporant to be aware of certain Cyber Security Threats. And how to analize the risks for security threats. In the document below I research Threat and Risk Analysis. Ontop of that I apply a form of risk analysis on a company myself.
